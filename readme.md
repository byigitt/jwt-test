# A Test Project for Learning JsonWebTokens

## What does it include?
It includes a backend code done with expressjs and uses mongodb as our database, a frontend code done with react with vite & did some basic login/register page with tailwindcss.

## Why did you do that?
I have a school project that is based on web and I needed to test myself about authorization and stuff (and see how fast I can do a similar project, I did this in approx 2 hours). I always used ejs and passport packages to show my work in static websites but I want to work more on dynamic websites and learn React and more. 

## Installation
- Go to backend and frontend folder and install all npm packages with `npm install`
- Go to backend folder and edit `.env.example` file with your own credentials & rename the file as `.env`
- In backend folder, use this command to start: `node .`
- In frontend folder, use this command to start: `npm run dev`

And you are good to go!
